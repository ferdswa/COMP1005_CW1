# COMP1005 2022 Coursework 01

## Introduction

This coursework focuses on writing an interesting program using functions, variables and operators. There is **one task** to complete, details of which are given below. Links to external pages are provided in the details below which you will need to follow and read to complete the task.

## Assessment

This coursework is worth **5%** of your final course grade. The points awarded for each task are as follows:

|            | Compilation | Implementation | Execution | **Total** |
| ---------- | :---------: | :------------: | :-------: | :-------: |
| **Task 1** | 2           | 1              | 4         | **7**     |

For **Task 1**, you are awarded *two* points if your program compiles correctly: *one* point if it compiles without errors, and a further *one* point if it compiles without errors *and* warnings. If your program follows the implementation instructions given in [Task 1 Details](#details-1) below, you are awarded *one* point. If your program produces the correct output as described in [Task 1 Details](#details-1) below, you are awarded *four* points.

Your score for each task can be viewed on GitLab after every push to `projects.cs.nott.ac.uk`. You can make as many revisions and pushes as you like, hopefully increasing your score as you do so. Your final score for the coursework will the score of your last push.

The contribution towards your final course grade is calculated as follows:

```maths
	floor(5 * task1_points_awarded / 7)
```

Your provisional score for each task can be viewed on GitLab after every push to `projects.cs.nott.ac.uk`. Your final score will be based on the code in the last commit pushed to `projects.cs.nott.ac.uk` *before* the coursework deadline. Commits pushed after the coursework deadline will be disregarded. After the coursework deadline, your code will undergo further review and, based on this review, your provisional score may go up or down. This further review will include checks for code plagiarism and for trivial implementations e.g. implementations just containing an empty main function or clearly not written following the task guidelines. Final scores will be published on the COMP1005 moodle pages around a week after the coursework deadline.

Your repository contains a file called `.gitlab-ci.yml`. This file is used during the assessment process and *must not* be removed or edited in any way. Any tampering with this file will result in a score of zero for this coursework.

This coursework is individual work i.e. *must be your own work* and follow the University [Academic integrity and misconduct](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/studyingeffectively/studying/integrity/index.aspx) guidance.

## Task 1

### Overview

The [Drake equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation) asserts to give an estimate of the number of intelligent civilisations, $`N`$, in our Milky Way galaxy. In its original form, the Drake equation calculates this estimate based on seven parameters. Your task is to write a program which calculates and prints $`N`$ for several different sets of parameters.

Your C source file for this task *must* be named `task1.c` and placed in the top-level directory of your git project for this coursework.

### Details

The original [Drake equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation) is:

```math
N = R_* \cdot f_p \cdot n_e \cdot f_l \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot L
```

Where $`N`$ is the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy, and the seven parameters are:

| Parameter | Description |
| :-----: | :--- |
| $`R_*`$ | the average rate of star formations in our galaxy |
| $`f_p`$ | the fraction of formed stars that have planets |
| $`n_e`$ | for stars that have planets, the average number of planets that can potentially support life |
| $`f_l`$ | the fraction of those planets that actually develop life |
| $`f_i`$ | the fraction of planets bearing life on which intelligent, civilized life, has developed |
| $`f_c`$ | the fraction of these civilizations that have developed communications |
| $`L`$   | the length of time over which such civilizations release detectable signals |

Your C source file should contain **two functions**: a `main` function and a function named `drake_equation`.

Your `drake_equation` function should calculate the Drake equation for a given set of parameters. The `drake_equation` function should take **seven arguments**, corresponding to the **seven parameters** in Drake's original equation, as described in the [Introduction](introduction-1) to this task. You should assume all arguments are double precision floating point numbers *except for* $`n_e`$ and $`L`$, which you should assume are integers. The `drake_equation` function should calculate and return the value of $`N`$ based on the values of the arguments passed to the function. $`N`$ should be returned as a non-negative integer.

Your `main` function should be defined correctly and should call the `drake_equation` function **four times** with the follow **four sets** of parameters:

|       | $`R_*`$ | $`f_p`$ | $`n_e`$ | $`f_l`$ | $`f_i`$ | $`f_c`$ | $`L`$ |
| :---: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :---: |
| Set 1 | 1.0     | 0.2     | 1       | 1.0     | 1.0     | 0.1     | 1000  |
| Set 2 | 1.0     | 0.5     | 5       | 1.0     | 1.0     | 0.2     | 1000000000  |
| Set 3 | 1.5     | 1.0     | 3       | 1.0     | 0.0001     | 0.001     | 304  |
| Set 4 | 3.0     | 1.0     | 5       | 1.0     | 1.0     | 0.1     | 10000000  |

*Set 1* and *Set 2* are Drake's original lower and upper estimates respectively for the parameters. *Set 3* and *Set 4* are possible lower and upper estimates respectively for the parameters based on current data.

After each call to `drake_equation`, your `main` function should print the value of $`N`$ calculated by the `drake_equation` function, along with the values of the seven parameters used in this calculation. You should print the results in the same order as above (*Set 1* first, then *Set 2*, then *Set 3*, then *Set 4*). Floating point numbers should be printed to **one decimal place**. Integers should be printed in standard (not scientific notation) form. The eight numbers should be printed together on a new line in the following format:

```
N=? R*=? fp=? ne=? fl=? fi=? fc=? L=?
```

where `?` is replaced by the values of each of the arguments the `drake_equation` function was called with and the value of $`N`$ calculated and returned by this function. So, the first output line of your program (*Set 1* above) will be:

```
N=20 R*=1.0 fp=0.2 ne=1 fl=1.0 fi=1.0 fc=0.1 L=1000
```

and so on for *Set 2*, *Set 3*, and *Set 4*.
